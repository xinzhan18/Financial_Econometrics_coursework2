Question a)

```{r}

std_error <- sqrt((employed_fraction * (1 - employed_fraction)) / nrow(data))

z_score <- qnorm(0.975)

conf_interval <- c(employed_fraction - z_score * std_error, employed_fraction + z_score * std_error)

print(paste("Fraction employed in April 2009:", employed_fraction))
print(paste("95% confidence interval for the probability of being employed in April 2009:", conf_interval))

```

Question b)
```{r}
lpm_model <- lm(employed ~ age + I(age^2), data = data)

summary(lpm_model)
